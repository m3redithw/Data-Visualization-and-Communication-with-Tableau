Question 1
The hourglass model is a framework for structuring effective business
presentations. Which of the following is NOT part of the hourglass model?  Choose all that apply.

# Opening your presentation with an agenda
# A complete description of all the analyses you tried

// Although the hourglass model does mention
agendas, it does not recommend that you open your presentation with an agenda
unless that’s what your company culture requires.  Further, it recommends that you only present
a few key analyses in a logical order, not every analysis that you tried.    


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2
Beginning your business
presentation in the middle of the plot of a motivational story can sometimes be
an effective way to lead into your business recommendation.

# True

// Beginning your business presentation in the
middle of the plot of a motivational story can create a sense of momentum and expectation for what will come next,
which can sometimes be an effective way to lead into your business
recommendation. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 3
The storyboarding
process includes:

# asking for feedback
# determining the precise order in which the scenes will be organized
# choosing the best visualizations to communicate the information of each scene
# narrowing in on the minimum number of scenes necessary to convey your data story

// The storyboarding
process includes all of these components.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 4
According to
the psychology literature, if the business recommendation you are going to make
in a business presentation is likely to be controversial, you should order the
stem of your presentation hourglass so that the:

# least controversial point is presented first.

// People are more likely to be persuaded by an argument
if you get them into a general feeling of agreement first, so starting with
your least controversial point will get your audience used to saying “yes”
before you present them with something to which they might want to say “no.”


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 5
As a data analyst, you can avoid the logical fallacy of overgeneralization by:

# none of the above

// None of these items can ensure that the effects you observe will generalize to all other types of data.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 6
To test whether a certain advertising campaign would work, an analytics team sorts
their customer list from lowest to highest customer ID number, and then sends
their advertisement to the first 1000 customers on the list.  The rest of the customers did not receive any
advertisements that week.  When analyzing
the results of the campaign one week later, the analytics team realized that there
was a previously unknown pattern in the customer ID numbers: the lower the
customer number, the longer the person had been a customer.  Thus,
the customers who received the advertisement were the individuals who had been
customers with the company the longest. 
The analytics team decided the test was invalid and needed to be
repeated.  The reason for their decision
was that analyzing the results in their current form would result in the
following logical fallacy (or fallacies):

# Over-generalization

// Although the team was correct to evaluate the causal power of the advertisement on purchasing
using a test, the testing group used was systematically different from the control group used (the rest of 
the customers) in ways other than whether or not they received an advertisement.\
All of the customers in the testing group would have been customers longer than the customers in the control group,
so it would have been impossible to differentiate whether any observed differences in purchasing between the two groups were due to the advertisement,
or due to how long customers had interacted with the company.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 7
When two variables are correlated, one variable does not cause the other variable.

# False

// Although a correlation between two variables does not mean one variable must cause the other variable,
it still permits the possibility that one variable causes the other.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 8
The best way to understand the nature of a relationship between two variables is to run a test.

# True

// The only way to find out if one factor causes another is to use the scientific method and
run a test or experiment where you change the variable you think is causing the effect you want, and hold all other factors constant.
Ideally you would start by running the tests in small-scale pilot scenarios where the stakes are lower,
before you run larger tests or make the recommendation to implement a full-scale change.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 9
Which charts should you
NOT use often in business presentations? 
 Choose all that apply.
 
# Scatter plots
# 3D charts

// Bar charts and line charts are very effective, and pie charts can be effective when they display small numbers of categories.
Scatter plots are too complicated for general audiences, and 3D charts tend to be misleading.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 10
When you want to represent very detailed
and nuanced information about continuous variables, given humans’ ability to
perceive relative differences along different kinds of visual attributes, which
of the following attributes should you exploit in your visualizations?  Choose the best 2 options.

# Length
# Position

// Humans are best at perceiving difference in position.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 11
If you are in a situation
where you MUST use colorbars to represent detailed information about a continuous
variable, you should:

# use a gray scale that goes from black to white.

// Black to white scales tend to have more even transitions than do color scales,
so what you perceive as 1 unit of change in color is more likely to represent 1 unit of physical distance
along a grayscale colorbar than a multi-colored colorbar.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 12
Visualizations for persuasion should: (Choose all that apply)

# direct your audience’s eyes to the precise points of the data that support your argument.
# show the visualizations in an order that helps your audience evaluate the options clearly.
# show selected pieces of data.

// Visualizations for analysis should often show as much data as possible,
but visualizations for persuasion should filter to show only the data that supports the argument you are making.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 13
Which of the following
reflect(s) the principles of maximizing the data-ink ratio?  Choose all that apply.

# Making the borders of bars in a graph the same as the slide background
# Reducing the amount of text on the slide

// Maximizing the data-ink ratio would lead to simplifying or completely removing non-essential scales and labels,
and excluding any symbols that indicated how far along you were in a presentation because those symbols would not be related to the data, itself.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 14
It’s a good idea to apply
the rule of thirds to: (Choose all that apply)

# Transition slides
# Slides illustrating stories
# Soft break slides
# Slides meant to catch your audience’s attention

// Data slides should display the data in the center of the slide and thus do not follow the rule of thirds.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 15
Practicing small parts of your
presentation at a time is an effective technique for creating confidence in
your ability to present the presentation as a whole.

# True

// This focused practice technique is nice because it breaks things down into bite-sized manageable pieces
so that you don’t feel so overwhelmed with having to remember everything at once.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 16
A hospital was having problems with the amount of time
employees with direct care responsibilities were absent from work. Due to the
high levels of absenteeism, patient satisfaction
was declining, 20% of patient-related
work was not getting done, and 47% of non-patient work was not getting
done.  At the advice of a consulting
company, the hospital implemented a positive incentive system that would allow
all employees to convert up to 24 hours of unused sick time into additional pay or more vacation days in
order to reduce absenteeism.  After 6
months of implementing the program, the hospital analysts calculated that
absentee rates declined an average of 11.5 hours per employee, and concluded that
the program was successful in this company. 
Did the hospital analysts commit any logical fallacies when arriving at
their conclusion, and if so, which fallacy (or fallacies)?

# Lack of controls

// Without a control
group who was not entered into the positive incentive system, it is impossible
to know whether the decrease in absenteeism was due to the change in policy or
due to other collections of unmeasured factors in the environment (like lower
overall sickness due to seasonal changes, for example).  The fallacy of overgeneralization was NOT committed because the analysts
concluded that the program worked in this company, and did not make claims
about whether or not the program would work in other places.  The fallacy of inferring causation from
correlation was NOT committed by the hospital analysts either, because they
never made an explicit claim about causation.
